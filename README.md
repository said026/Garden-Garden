# Garden-Garden

The concept behind GardenGarden is bring people get involved in gardening for the good of the community and break their daily routines by volunteering and watering a plant or a flower in a city garden. Sensors would monitor the need of each and every plant and then schedule/list of the tasks to be done with instruction on how to get it done :)
